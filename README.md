# PhantomFN Ground Code Base

> Real talk: This is the early foundation. The actual PhantomFN has been completely rebuilt. Think of this as the archaeological dig before the mansion got built.

## what this actually is

- **Foundation code only** — the groundwork before everything got rewritten
- **Not the full version** — missing all the optimizations, features, and pain points we've learned since
- **Educational reference** — see how we laid the bricks before torching them and starting over
- **The unoptimized draft** — version 0.5 energy, basically

## what this is NOT

- the official PhantomFN source (that lives in the discord server)
- production-ready code (do not ship this, i am begging you)
- the latest and greatest (we threw half of this away for reasons)

## actually useful links

- **Official updates & support:** [Join the Discord](https://dsc.gg/astralock)
- **Want the real code?** Check the server, this ain't it chief

## legal stuff nobody reads

All trademarks, logos, and names are owned by their respective overlords. this repo isn't affiliated with PhantomFN — it's just the skeleton they left behind.
